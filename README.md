# Data Structures and Algorithms I C949

## Assignment - Array Sorting and Hashmaps

### About this Assignment

The design and analysis of efficient data structures have long been recognized as a core subject in computing. Almost every enterprise application uses various types of data structures. In this course, you've learned about Big-Oh notation, multiple recursion, stacks, queues and graph algorithms. When writing programs and using algorithms to solve programming problems it helps to solidify your understanding of the material and demonstrates how the chapter's concepts are applied.

For this assignment, you will write an application using the Java programming language. This is a two-part Java program that focuses on sorting and searching arrays and HashMaps. It is essential to leave comments in your code that explain its design.

### Navigating Data

#### Part 1: Sorting Arrays
Develop a program that asks the user to enter a capital for a U.S. state. Upon receiving the user input, the program reports whether the user input is correct. For this application, the 50 states and their capitals are stored in a two-dimensional array in order by state name. Display the current contents of the array then use a bubble sort to sort the content by capital. Next, prompt the user to enter answers for all the state capitals and then display the total correct count. The user's answer is not case-sensitive.

#### Part 2: Sorting & Searching HashMap
Now revise the code to store the pairs of each state and its capital in a Map using the HashMap function. Display the content of the Map, then use the TreeMap class to sort the map while using a binary search tree for storage. Next, your program should prompt the user to enter a state and it should then display the capital for the state.
